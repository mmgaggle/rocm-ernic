# Self-hosted CI

This directory holds the harness that turns a lab node
into a GitHub Actions runner for rocm-ernic, capable of
booting real VMs over the emulated RDMA NIC and
producing functional and performance reports.

The GitHub-hosted workflows in `.github/workflows/` can
only build and unit-test. Everything that needs KVM, a
provisioned guest image or two guests talking RDMA to
each other runs here instead.

## Design

Everything runs **unprivileged**. There is no `sudo`, no
`systemctl`, and nothing is written to `/run`,
`/var/log` or `/usr/local`. This works because the
rocm-ernic launcher and `ernicctl` are entirely
environment-driven, so the whole control plane can be
redirected under a workspace the CI user owns:

| Normal path | CI path |
|---|---|
| `/run/rocm-ernic` | `$CI_WORK/run` |
| `/var/log/rocm-ernic` | `$CI_WORK/log` |
| `/usr/local/bin/rocm-ernic` | `$CI_WORK/build/rocm-ernic` |
| `systemctl start rocm-ernic` | `service/rocm-ernic-launcher` |

`$CI_WORK` defaults to `/var/tmp/ernic-ci-work`, which
is on local disk. Home directories on the lab nodes are
NFS, where qcow2 and build traffic is markedly slower.

The CI runs the checked-out copies of
`service/rocm-ernic-launcher` and `service/ernicctl`
rather than whatever is installed system-wide, so a run
always tests the tree it was handed.

### Reusing the Ansible harness

The test logic is not duplicated here. `ansible/` already
implements guest provisioning, the sanity suite and the
performance sweeps, and the CI drives those plays
directly through `ansible/ci-site.yml`.

`site.yml` is the developer entry point and needs root:
it installs to `/usr/local`, drives systemd, and binds
devices to `vfio-pci`. `ci-site.yml` skips all of that.
It assumes `ci/jobs/vm-up.sh` has already brought VMs up
unprivileged, and supplies only the inventory registration
those plays need, via `ansible/playbooks/vm-register.yml`
-- the same play the developer path uses.

The guest disk is **pulled from the registry**, not
regenerated. `vm-up.sh` fetches the artifact named by
`CI_GUEST_ARTIFACT_TAG` through
`scripts/fetch-guest-image.sh` and unpacks it under
`CI_VM_ARTIFACT_DIR`, skipping the download when that tag
is already present. Needing no root is the point: baking a
guest image locally needs `qemu-nbd` and root, and pinning
the tag means CI tests the same image the hosted workflow
does. The image itself is built elsewhere, by the `ionic`
flavour of [batesste-ci-images][ref-ci-images].

The fetch is also the gate. `fetch_guest_image` in
`lib/common.sh` passes the login account, disk name, release
and flavour the artifact is known to ship, and the script
rejects an image whose `vm-info.json` disagrees, or whose
kernel is below 6.18, skewed from `IONIC_KERNEL_REF`, or
different from the badge on `README.md`. Those checks run
after the kilobyte metadata pull and before the 3.7 GB disk
pull, so a wrong image fails in seconds rather than forty
minutes into a lane. The expectations come from
`CI_GUEST_IMAGE_USER` and `CI_GUEST_IMAGE_DISK`, not from
`CI_VM_SSH_USER` and `CI_VM_BACKING`, so overriding either of
those knobs still fetches.

Keep the tag equal to `GUEST_ARTIFACT_TAG`
in `.github/workflows/system-tests.yml` and
`ernic_vm_artifact_tag` in `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`.

The backing qcow2 is never written at runtime -- each VM
gets its own overlay -- so unlike the VM names and SSH
ports, the image is deliberately *not* made distinct per
checkout.

## Tiers

| Tier | Job | Needs KVM |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | build, ctest, loopback backend | no |
| 2 | two-VM RDMA functional, one-VM NVMe-oF | yes |
| 3 | performance sweeps | yes |

Tier 1 is fully self-contained and is the gate for
everything else. Tiers 2 and 3 are scheduled onto
runners carrying the `kvm` label, so a node that loses
KVM access stops attracting those jobs rather than
failing them.

Performance jobs refuse to run under emulation.
Software-emulated numbers are one to two orders of
magnitude off and would poison the regression baseline,
so `ci/jobs/perf.sh` exits rather than record them.

## Setting up a node

Check what the node can do:

```bash
ci/doctor.sh
```

It reports per-tier readiness and exits `0` for the full
matrix, `1` if only tier 1 can run, and `2` if the node
cannot run CI at all.

Stage the runner (downloads and unpacks it, writes a
systemd user unit, enables lingering so it survives
reboot):

```bash
ci/runner/install-runner.sh
```

The runner is installed to `/local/$USER/`, not `$HOME`.
Home is NFS on the lab node, and a long-lived runner
daemon does not belong on a shared filer: every job would
pay filer latency, an outage would take the runner down,
and its `.credentials` would sit on shared storage.
`/local` is the node's per-user local-disk area, on the
same ext4 volume as the work directory. On a fresh node
that directory has to be created once:

```bash
sudo install -d -o "$USER" -g "$(id -gn)" -m 0755 /local/"$USER"
```

Override with `--root` or `CI_RUNNER_ROOT` if your node
lays out local storage differently.

`install-runner.sh` also creates the TAP interfaces the
emulated ionic device needs — `ernic-ci-br0` plus one
`ernic-ci-tapN` per instance, owned by the runner user.
That is the one step needing root, and it needs it once:
jobs themselves never use `sudo`, and an unprivileged
runner cannot create a TAP for itself. Without them the
guests come up with no Ethernet and every guest-to-guest
test fails one at a time without saying why, so
`ci/doctor.sh` and `ci/jobs/vm-up.sh` check for them up
front. Pass `--skip-taps` if the node already has them or
you would rather run the `ip` commands by hand; without
passwordless `sudo` the step warns and skips itself.

This deliberately stops short of registering. Mint a
registration token at
`https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-ernic/settings/actions/runners/new`
and then:

```bash
ci/runner/register-runner.sh --token <TOKEN>
```

Registration tokens expire after one hour. The script
applies the `kvm` label only when `/dev/kvm` is actually
usable; re-run it with `--replace` after fixing KVM to
refresh the labels.

Manage the runner with:

```bash
systemctl --user status rocm-ernic-runner
journalctl --user -u rocm-ernic-runner -f
```

## Security

`ROCm/rocm-ernic` is public, and this workflow runs on a
lab machine rather than a throwaway GitHub runner. Nothing
reaches the node unless someone asks for it:
`.github/workflows/self-hosted-ci.yml` has **no
`pull_request` trigger and no `push` trigger**. The only
ways in are `workflow_dispatch` and the nightly schedule.

That is a deliberate trade. Pull requests get no automatic
lab-node coverage; a maintainer runs `/run-ci` when they
want it. The GitHub-hosted workflows still run on every
pull request as usual, so contributors are not left
without feedback.

### Testing fork pull requests

Fork pull requests **are** runnable, via the `pr` input:

```bash
gh workflow run self-hosted-ci.yml --ref develop -f pr=123
```

or just `/run-ci` on the pull request.

What makes that acceptable is the split between the
workflow and the code it tests. The dispatch targets the
workflow file on the **default branch**, and passes only a
pull request number. Each job then checks out
`refs/pull/<pr>/head`, which resolves for forks. So a fork
supplies code to compile and run, but cannot change what
the workflow does with it, and cannot start a run at all:
`workflow_dispatch` requires write access.

### What this does not protect

The node itself. Fork code runs as the runner's user, with
whatever that user can do. **Treat the ability to dispatch
a fork pull request as equivalent to shell access on the
lab node.**

On the current node the runner user also has passwordless
`sudo`, so that is equivalent to root. Outstanding
hardening, in rough priority order:

1. Run the runner as a dedicated account with no `sudo`.
2. Give that account its own `/local/<user>` workspace and
   `/opt/qemu-images` group access, rather than reusing a
   developer's.
3. Consider an ephemeral runner, so each job starts from a
   clean machine state.

Until those land, only dispatch fork pull requests whose
diff you have actually read.

The workflow also takes a `concurrency` lock. Two
simultaneous runs would collide on VM ssh ports, the
instance manifest and the qcow2 overlays.

## Triggering from a comment

`.github/workflows/ci-command.yml` adds a slash command
usable from any pull request or issue:

| Command | Runs |
|---|---|
| `/run-ci` | build, loopback, two-VM RDMA and NVMe-oF functional |
| `/run-ci build` | build, ctest and loopback only |
| `/run-ci functional` | same as bare `/run-ci` |
| `/run-ci full` | functional plus performance sweeps |
| `/run-ci full tcg` | VMs under emulation, no valid perf |
| `/run-ci help` | print usage |

Arguments are order-insensitive and case-insensitive, so
`/run-ci tcg full` and `/run-ci FULL TCG` both work.

The dispatcher reacts to the comment, dispatches the
workflow against the right ref, and replies with a link
to the run.

Three properties keep this honest on a public repository:

1. The dispatcher runs on `ubuntu-latest`, never on the
   self-hosted runner, so untrusted comment text is
   never processed on the lab node.
2. The commenter must have write access or above,
   checked against the API at trigger time.
3. The dispatch always targets the workflow file on the
   default branch and passes the pull request number as an
   input, so a fork supplies the code under test but not
   the workflow that runs it.

Fork pull requests are eligible. See *What this does not
protect* above before running one.

`issue_comment` always runs the workflow file from the
default branch, so this gate cannot be weakened by a
pull request.

Note that `workflow_dispatch` only resolves workflows
present on the default branch. Both
`self-hosted-ci.yml` and `ci-command.yml` must be merged
to `develop` before the command works, even when targeting
a topic branch.

## Reporting back

When a run is started with a `pr` number, the report job
comments the outcome on that pull request when it finishes:
a per-stage table, the check and regression counts, and a
link to the run. It posts under `always()`, so a failed or
half-skipped run still reports rather than going quiet.

Runs without a `pr` (the nightly) do not comment anywhere;
their outcome is the run's own status and the job summary.

## Publishing performance trends

The scheduled run publishes its medians to the docs site at
<https://rocm.github.io/rocm-ernic/>, under *Performance
trends*.

All three badges are fed on identical terms. `system-tests.yml`
is the single entry point, and both of its publishing lanes --
the two-VM one for `perftest`/`iperf3`, the NVMe-oF one for the
fio sweep -- hand off to the same composite action,
`.github/actions/publish-perf`. There is one copy of the commit,
push and Pages-dispatch logic, so a bug in it is fixed once rather
than per lane.

### Nothing CI writes lands on `develop`

`develop` is source only. The published site and the data behind it
live on the orphan `gh-pages` branch, which is also what GitHub
Pages serves (Settings > Pages > "Deploy from a branch",
`gh-pages` / root):

```
/                    built Sphinx HTML
/.nojekyll
/perf/history.jsonl  the durable record, one JSON object per run
/perf/badge-*.json   the shields the README points at
```

`perf/` has no leading underscore deliberately, so it is served
even if `.nojekyll` is ever lost.

A publishing lane clones `gh-pages`, copies `perf/history.jsonl`
into `docs/perf-history/`, runs `ci/report/publish-perf.py` to
append its record and refresh the badges, copies both back into
`perf/` and pushes. It never touches the built HTML, so a perf
run cannot disturb the site.

That push is made with the job's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which
GitHub's loop-prevention rule exempts from starting other workflow
runs, so the lane then dispatches `docs-deploy.yml` explicitly
(`workflow_dispatch`, needs `actions: write`) to rebuild the site.
`docs-deploy` fetches `perf/history.jsonl` back off `gh-pages`,
renders the trend page from it (`publish-perf.py --render-only`),
builds Sphinx and `rsync -a --delete --exclude perf/`s the result
onto `gh-pages`. The exclusion is what keeps the two halves of the
branch from clobbering each other.

The badges are therefore correct the moment a lane pushes: they no
longer wait on a Sphinx build, which is what left run `35270045274`
publishing a real number behind a stale shield.

`docs/perf-history/history.jsonl` is committed to `develop` **empty**,
with `"no data"` badges and a stub `docs/perf-trends.rst`, so a
local `make docs` or a pull request build still renders a complete
site with no toctree warnings. To see the real page locally, fetch
the history first:

```sh
git show origin/gh-pages:perf/history.jsonl \
    > docs/perf-history/history.jsonl
python3 ci/report/publish-perf.py --render-only --docs-dir docs
```

### Only GitHub-hosted runs publish

Every published number comes off a GitHub-hosted runner. The
self-hosted lane still sweeps, reports and gates regressions, but
its figures stay in the run's artifacts and never reach the docs
site or the shields.

The reason is comparability. A GitHub runner has noisy neighbours
and no fixed CPU; `hpe-rack-15` has neither. Interleaving the two
in one series produces a chart whose every other point is a step
change in the machine rather than in the code, which is exactly the
signal the trend exists to show. Publishing from one class of
machine keeps the line meaningful even though it is the noisier
class.

`publish-perf.py --runner` records the class on each history entry
(`github-hosted` or `self-hosted`), and the page charts each class
on its own axes. Records written before that flag existed carry no
`runner` key and are read as `self-hosted`, which is where they
came from. The shields read the `github-hosted` series only: a
fallback across classes would put a lab-node number behind a label
the README presents as a GitHub-hosted one.

### The shields

Each publishing run writes one shields.io [endpoint badge][shields-endpoint]
per transport into `docs/perf-history/`, each falling back to the
latest prior run *of the same runner class* that has a value, so one
bad sweep does not grey a badge out:

| File | Metric | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `badge-rdma.json` | `ib_send_bw`, 1 MiB, peak GB/s | `system-tests.yml` |
| `badge-tcp.json` | `iperf3`, sustained GB/s | `system-tests.yml` |
| `badge-nvmeof.json` | fio randread, 4 KiB, IOPS | `system-tests.yml` |

The lane copies them to `perf/` on `gh-pages`, so each badge is
reachable at
`https://rocm.github.io/rocm-ernic/perf/badge-<name>.json` as soon
as that push lands -- no doc build in between.

README.md links all three. All three currently ship with a
committed `"no data"` placeholder: the `github-hosted` series
starts empty, and the RDMA and TCP numbers that were there before
came off the lab node, so continuing to show them under these
labels would be a wrong answer rather than a stale one. The
placeholder matters -- without a file at that URL shields.io
renders an *error*, which looks far worse than a grey "no data".
Expect real numbers after the first green `system-tests` run on
`develop`, whether scheduled or dispatched by hand.

[shields-endpoint]: https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge

### Publishing on demand

Waiting for 04:23 UTC is optional. `system-tests.yml` takes a
`workflow_dispatch` with a `publish` boolean (default true), so a
manual run against `develop` fills all three shields:

```bash
gh workflow run system-tests.yml --ref develop
```

Pass `-f publish=false` to exercise the sweeps without touching
the history -- useful when the sweep itself is what you are
testing. Dispatching anything other than `--ref develop` sweeps but
never publishes, by the same rule below.

Budget for it: the two-VM lane boots two guests and runs for the
best part of an hour, so this is not a quick way to refresh a
badge. The NVMe-oF lane finishes much sooner and pushes as soon
as it does, rather than waiting for its slower sibling.

The workflow does not cancel in-progress runs on `develop`, so a
dispatch will not kill a scheduled run part-way through its push;
the two queue instead.

Only a green run on `develop` publishes. Pull request runs never
do -- a pull request's numbers describe the pull request, not
`develop` -- and on `system-tests.yml` they do not even sweep:
the two perf plays are minutes of `perftest` and `iperf3` on top
of a job that already runs the best part of an hour, for numbers
that would be discarded.

Charts are inline SVG with no JavaScript and no extra build
dependency. Each message size gets its own panel and its own
scale: 4 KiB bandwidth is around 0.15 GB/s against roughly 7
at 1 MiB, and on a shared axis the small sizes flatten onto
the baseline, hiding exactly the movement a regression would
show. Every chart is also rendered as a table, which is both
the accessible reading and the relief required for the one
palette colour that sits below 3:1 on the light surface.

Publishing never fails a run. Every git step in the publish
block warns and exits 0 rather than propagating: if `develop`
moved underneath the job, if the push is rejected, or if git
cannot read the repository at all, the run keeps the result it
actually earned. That last case is not hypothetical -- these
lanes run in a container, where the workspace arrives owned by
another uid and `actions/checkout`'s `safe.directory` entry is
out of scope, so the publish block marks the workspace safe
itself before touching git.

## Running jobs by hand

Each job is a standalone script and can be run outside
Actions:

```bash
bash ci/jobs/build.sh          # configure, build, ctest
bash ci/jobs/loopback.sh       # loopback backend suite
bash ci/jobs/vm-up.sh          # boot the CI VMs
bash ci/jobs/vm-functional.sh  # RDMA functional tests
bash ci/jobs/vm-nvmeof.sh      # NVMe-oF functional tests
bash ci/jobs/vm-uet.sh         # UET between the guests' engines
bash ci/jobs/perf.sh           # performance sweeps
bash ci/jobs/vm-down.sh        # tear down
```

`vm-nvmeof.sh` is the one lane that needs a different VM
bring-up: the controller lives inside the instance, so a
single guest talking to a single server is a complete
fabric and the instances have to be started on the nvmeof
backend.

It aims the connect at the controller's queue ceiling -- `-i
$NVMEOF_QUEUES -W $NVMEOF_QUEUES` -- and then asserts that
`/sys/class/nvme/nvmeN/queue_count` agrees. Unpinned,
`nvme-rdma` asks for one I/O queue per online CPU, so the lane
would cover whatever the runner happened to have rather than
what the controller advertises. Both flags are needed: each of
`-i`, `-W` and `-P` is clamped to the CPU count separately and
then summed, so `-i 8` on its own tops out at the vCPU count.

`NVMEOF_QUEUES` defaults to the `queues=` key of
`ERNIC_BACKEND` -- eight when the key is absent, which is the
server's own default -- so the documented `queues=4`
reproduction in `docs/nvmeof-performance.rst` asserts against
five queues rather than nine. The expectation is computed as
`min(2 * min(queues, nproc), queues) + 1`; a guest with fewer
than half the ceiling in vCPUs cannot reach it, and that is
logged rather than failed.

Export both, rather than prefixing a single command: all
three scripts read them, and `ERNIC_INSTANCES` defaults to 2.

```bash
export ERNIC_INSTANCES=1
export ERNIC_BACKEND=nvmeof:size=256M,bs=4096
bash ci/jobs/vm-up.sh
bash ci/jobs/vm-nvmeof.sh
bash ci/jobs/vm-down.sh
```

`vm-uet.sh` needs the instances to run UET engines, so it
needs a build with `-DERNIC_UET=ON` and `ERNIC_UET` set for the
launcher, and guest setup from `vm-functional.sh`. See
`docs/uet.rst` ("Two VMs") for the checks, the TSS pass and
the opt-in interop with the software provider on the host.

```bash
export CI_BUILD_DIR=$PWD/build-uet
export ERNIC_UET='ip=192.168.200.10%i'
export UET_PROV_DIR=/path/to/uet-ref-prov
bash ci/jobs/vm-up.sh
bash ci/jobs/vm-functional.sh
bash ci/jobs/vm-uet.sh
```

Useful overrides:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CI_WORK` | `/var/tmp/ernic-ci-work` | workspace root |
| `CI_BUILD_TYPE` | `Release` | CMake build type |
| `CI_VM_ACCEL` | `kvm` | set `tcg` to emulate |
| `CI_TAP_PREFIX` | `ernic-ci-tap` | per-instance TAP name prefix |
| `CI_TAP_BRIDGE` | `ernic-ci-br0` | bridge the TAPs are enslaved to |
| `ERNIC_INSTANCES` | `2` | number of VMs |
| `CI_VM_SSH_BASE_PORT` | `2350` | first guest ssh port |
| `CI_KEEP_OVERLAYS` | `false` | keep qcow2 after teardown |
| `CI_GUEST_ARTIFACT_REPO` | see `ci/lib/common.sh` | OCI repo holding the guest image |
| `CI_GUEST_ARTIFACT_TAG` | see `ci/lib/common.sh` | image tag to pull |
| `CI_VM_ARTIFACT_DIR` | `${CI_VM_IMAGE_DIR}/artifacts/${CI_GUEST_ARTIFACT_TAG}` | where it is unpacked |
| `CI_VM_BACKING` | the artifact's qcow2 | backing disk for the overlays |
| `CI_VM_SSH_USER` | `batesste` | guest login account |
| `CI_VM_SSH_IDENTITY` | the artifact's `id_rsa` | key used for guest ssh |
| `CI_VM_VCPUS` | `8` | guest vCPUs |
| `NVMEOF_QUEUES` | `ERNIC_BACKEND`'s `queues=`, else `8` | queue ceiling the connect aims at |

VM names and ports are deliberately distinct from the
interactive defaults in `/etc/rocm-ernic/rocm-ernic.env`
so a CI run can never disturb a developer's VMs on the
same box. Teardown only ever matches VMs it launched.
The guest image is the exception, for the reason given
above: it is read-only at runtime, and sharing it is what
makes CI and the developer path test the same thing.

## Reports

`ci/report/gen-report.py` merges three sources into one
report:

- `$CI_WORK/results/*.jsonl` — shell-level check results
- `$CI_WORK/results/junit/*.xml` — Ansible task results,
  captured via the `junit` callback plugin
- `$CI_WORK/results/perf-csv/*.csv` — perftest and
  iperf3 sweeps

It writes `report.md` and `summary.json`, and appends
the report to the GitHub step summary. Failed
measurements are shown as an incomplete sample count
rather than dropped, so a run that silently stopped
measuring is visible.

Regression checking compares medians against a stored
baseline:

```bash
python3 ci/report/gen-report.py \
    --results "$CI_WORK/results" \
    --out "$CI_WORK/report" \
    --baseline "$CI_WORK/baseline/summary.json" \
    --threshold 15
```

Latency metrics are inverted so that "worse" is always
negative. The script exits non-zero on any functional
failure or regression, which is what gates the workflow.

Only a clean tier-3 run on `develop` updates the baseline,
so a failing or partial run can never quietly lower the
bar.

### What is gated, and why not everything

Only latency is gated by default. Two back-to-back clean
sweeps on the same host and build differ far more by
metric than you might expect:

| Metric | median | worst |
|---|---:|---:|
| `lat_max_us` | 1.0% | 11.9% |
| `lat_typical_us` | 1.0% | 28.6% |
| `bw_peak_GBs` | 7.4% | 69.0% |
| `bw_avg_GBs` | 7.0% | 153.6% |
| `msg_rate_mpps` | 7.1% | 152.8% |

Averaged bandwidth and message rate swing too wide on an
emulated two-VM setup to gate on. At any threshold tight
enough to catch a real regression they fire on noise, and
a gate that cries wolf nightly gets ignored. They are
still measured and reported, just not failed on. Add
others with `--gate-metric` if a workload proves stable
enough to warrant it.

Build the baseline from the median of at least two clean
sweeps rather than a single run; one run bakes in
whichever way the noise happened to fall. The baseline
lives under `$CI_WORK`, not in git, because it describes
one host: numbers from this node are not meaningful on
another. Rebuilding a node means recapturing it.

# install-runner.sh -- stage a GitHub Actions self-hosted
# runner on this node.
#
# This only downloads and unpacks the runner and writes
# the systemd user unit.  It deliberately does NOT
# register with GitHub: registration needs a short-lived
# token that only a repo admin can mint, and pointing a
# runner at a public repository is a decision that
# should be made explicitly.  Run register-runner.sh
# once you have a token.
#
# Only the TAP step needs root, and only once: each server
# instance attaches to a TAP enslaved to a shared bridge, and an
# unprivileged runner cannot create those for itself.  Skip
# it with --skip-taps if the node already has them or you
# want to run the ip commands by hand.  Persistence across
# reboots comes from a systemd *user* service plus lingering,
# which loginctl grants to your own account.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/runner/install-runner.sh [--version 2.337.0] [--skip-taps]

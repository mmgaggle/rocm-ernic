rocm-ernic: Emulated RDMA NIC for Virtual Machines
===================================================

Introduction
------------

rocm-ernic is a userspace RDMA device server built on the
`libvfio-user <https://github.com/nutanix/libvfio-user>`_
framework. It provides full RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)
functionality to virtual machines without requiring physical
RDMA hardware or an in-guest software stack such as
`Soft-RoCE <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rxe.7.html>`_.

Key Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Full PCIe device emulation in userspace
- An AMD Pensando ionic NIC, driven in the guest by the
  upstream Linux ``ionic`` and ``ionic_rdma`` drivers
  (see :doc:`ionic`)
- Memory-mapped BARs (MSI-X, registers, doorbells)
- MSI-X interrupt support
- Multiple RDMA backends (loopback, TCP/IP, native verbs)
- An in-process NVMe-oF target, so one VM and one server
  are a complete fabric (see :doc:`nvmeof`)
- An in-process S3-over-RDMA object store, with its own
  in-band HTTP endpoint on the emulated wire, so the same
  single VM is a complete object fabric (see :doc:`s3`)
- An optional Ultra Ethernet Transport engine that runs the
  UEC reference stack as the NIC's firmware, at its own
  address on the wire (see :doc:`uet`)
- Working Ethernet and TCP/IP to the host via a TAP
  interface
- Comprehensive statistics collection

Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install cmake meson ninja-build pkg-config \
     libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev libglib2.0-dev libjson-c-dev
   cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   cmake --build build

   ./build/rocm-ernic \
     --socket /tmp/vfio-user-rocm-ernic.sock \
     --backend loopback --verbose

That presents the device to the guest as an upstream-driven
ionic NIC. Add ``--tap`` to attach its Ethernet interface to
a host TAP:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build/rocm-ernic \
     --socket /tmp/vfio-user-rocm-ernic.sock \
     --backend loopback --tap ernic0
